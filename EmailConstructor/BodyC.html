    Hey {firstname},
</p>

<p>
  I wanted to follow up one last time to see if you are still interested in demo-ing one of our video borescopes. We'll do whatever we can to make the demo process as easy and hassle free. You don't need to send us anything and we won't charge you anything; just let me know that you are interested and we'll ship a unit out to you on our dime and well send you a pre-paid shipping label to use to send it back to us once you've had a chance to play with it.
</p>
<p>
  If you aren't the right person at your company to be talking to about this, could you let me know who is? If you'd rather, you can forward these messages on to the right person and have them drop me a line.

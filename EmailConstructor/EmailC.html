    Hey [Contact.First Name],
</p>

<p>
  I wanted to follow up one last time to see if you are still interested in demo-ing one of our video borescopes. We'll do whatever we can to make the demo process as easy and hassle free. You don't need to send us anything and we won't charge you anything; just let me know that you are interested and we'll ship a unit out to you on our dime and well send you a pre-paid shipping label to use to send it back to us once you've had a chance to play with it.
</p>
<p>
  If you aren't the right person at your company to be talking to about this, could you let me know who is? If you'd rather, you can forward these messages on to the right person and have them drop me a line.
</p>

<p>
  Would you be open to an on-site evaluation of one of our video borescope units? I don’t need to be there, we can just ship you the unit (at our expense, of course) and you can use it for a week or two to see how it performs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it meets your expectations, we can move toward a purchase, if not, I’ll send you a shipping label to get the scope back to us.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you haven't used a state-of-the-art video borescope recently, you really do owe it to yourself to take this test drive.  Our scope saves time and money, and improves quality, for hundreds of companies like yours.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please let me know when it would be convenient to have a quick call to set up your demo. You can reply to this email or call me at my office or on my mobile.
